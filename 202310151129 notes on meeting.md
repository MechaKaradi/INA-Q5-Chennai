Three possible directions for project: 
1. Deep dive on responsibilities assigned to commissioner GCC or other administrative positions and create an institutional map of their tasks
2. Create a network of required actions for a specific task like integrated watershed planning and extract atomic actions and actors from the network
3. Ambiguity in preparedness and resilience actions
4. Develop a network of disaster response / planning actions to identify gaps toward allocation of atomic responsibilities - the consequences of ambiguity in disaster response or disaster preparedness
