Notes: 

This statement is not atomic: 
a) CMDA is the entity that does planning, not GCC or any other member. + committee members are too high level to effectively conduct this activity, 

there needs to be a specific, time bound action with a well defined out come and dedicated resources. 

Lack of specificity leads to procurement of consultants that lack context and experience in the region and do not employ the appropriate tools

b) there is no agreed upon definition of 'likely' or 'inundated' in this context. 

c) lacks follow up
