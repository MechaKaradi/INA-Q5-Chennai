Notes: 
The actual function of land and building use zoning and regulation is split between the GCC and [[CMDA]]. Resettlement of encroachments is responsibility of [[TN Housing Developement Board (or Slum Clearance Board)]]

Within GCC there may be ambiguity of actor because Stormwater and Drainage Department is responsible for watershed planning, but Buildings/Estates Department is partly responsible for building permissions and monitoring. 

No clear activation criteria exists
